<blockquote>
  <p>DAO.casino is a protocol defining interactions between untrusted participants in the context of online gambling industry. This includes two levels: game level - player’s trust in a particular casino operator in the context of the game (provably fair gambling) and a business model level: i.e. game developer doesn’t have to trust casino operator to get rewarded. In short: all participants that are needed for the system to function don’t have to trust each other in order to cooperate.</p>
