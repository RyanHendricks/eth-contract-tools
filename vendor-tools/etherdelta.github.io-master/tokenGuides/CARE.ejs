<blockquote>
  <p>CareCoin Community idea was conceived by a group of 6 blockchain enthusiast individuals highly motivated to bring into existence a global open-access interactive digitized platform using blockchain technology which enables people across the globe to provide monetary assistance to their fellow human beings in need. The idea is to keep the functionality and design of the platform very user-friendly so everyday people, even the ones who are less computer savvy, find it easy to interact with. You may ask, why one would need CareCoin platform when there is already a platform like gofundme.com. Well, there is no doubt gofundme.com is a great initiative in this approach, however, it lacks a functional mechanism to protect the donors against fraudsters; furthermore, a considerable percentage of donations are deducted as fees before the funds are released to the donees. CareCoin Community promises to develop an autonomous community consensus-driven global donation ecosystem which protects against fraudsters and ultimately eliminates the fees completely so every penny donated by a donor is utilized by the donee.</p>
