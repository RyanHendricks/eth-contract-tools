CryptoSocial is a social network aimed at the public of crypto-currencies, so that its users share their experiences, but hear an event that made everything change, the users started of the project marketing and serve ads, using the points of refference of the platform , transforming the platform into much more than a simple social network, but in a marketing platform with centralized target public, so we decided to create a decentralized token to subsidize our users with something that they can use beyond the borders of CryptoSocial.</p>
