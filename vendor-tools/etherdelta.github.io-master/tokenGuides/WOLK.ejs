  <p>Data is the world's most valuable resource. Currently, the world's most powerful data sets sit locked behind walled gardens. Data needs to be unlocked in a way that honors individuals needs for privacy.  App publishers have a lot of valuable data that is going undervalued or un-monetized at all.  Data buyers have limited options for where to buy this type of data and often times have no transparency as to the cost being paid for the data (because it's often bundled with advertising). Wolk is providing data suppliers such as these app developers and alternative method of monetizing their data (if not primary) by connecting them (at scale) to these data buyers. By doing this, we make valuable data more accessible. By decentralizing access to the richest data sets, there is no limit on how humanity can grow and improve. The Wolk Protocol defines how data buyers and suppliers use decentralized virtual currencies (WOLK token) with APIs (Wolk API) to transact using decentralized backend storage.</p>
